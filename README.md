# School Instagram Scraper
Project which scrapes photos of my school's teacher absence list from Instagram, uses Tesseract, an optical character recognition tool, to read and detect text embedded in the images, and finally matches detected text with user input to indicate which teachers are absent that day. 

## How to run the algorithm
Install Selenium and Pytesseract
```python
pip install pytesseract
```
```python
pip install selenium
```
